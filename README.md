# pestenCardGame

Pesten is the DuTch Card Game.

Game Rules

● Shuffle a deck of 52 playing cards (no Jokers). Pass seven cards to each player.
The remainder is called the drawing stack.
● At the beginning of the game the topmost card is revealed, then the players each
get a turn to play cards.
● One can play a card if it corresponds to the suit or value of the open card. E.g. on
a 10 of spades, only other spades can be played or other 10s. If a player is not
able to play, they should draw one card from the stack
● Once the drawing stack is empty, the player will have to skip a turn if he / she
cannot play a card.
● Whoever gets rid of his/her cards first wins the game.
